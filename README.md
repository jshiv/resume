### Experience	

**Udemy** *Senior Software Engineer, Data Platform* __June 2019 to Present__

* Developed mysql to s3 pipeline to process mysql binlogs through a kafka into a scala spark streaming application that provides distributed updates and deletes in apache hudi format on AWS s3.

* Used ansible and terraform to build and maintain production data infrastructure in AWS including multiple AWS EMR clusters that ran up to 880 cores and 7 TB of memory.

* Rotated in on-call schedule to ensure infrastructure was reliable and ~1K jobs passed on a daily basis.

**Waymo** *Senior Data Scientist* __June 2018 to June 2019__

* Designed and developed the python run feature extractor pipeline. Built on apache beam, flume, borg, python and protobuff, the framework provides users a simple design pattern to extract features[counts, histograms, rainflow matrix], from vehicle and sds log data, and  then to scale over the whole fleet processing 100's of TB in minutes. 

* Developed Metropolis Hastings algorithm in Go for sampling from a Weibull posterior with arbitrary priors. 

* Developed Markov chain Monte Carlo python code base for accurately forecasting field failures in complex systems.

* Developed Reliability analytics data pipeline and dashboards for report automation. 

**Mayfield Robotics** *Data Engineer, Consultant* __March 2018 to June 2018__

* Data Warehouse: Designed and implemented analytics data infrastructure using spark via AWS Glue to process robot logs and disparate data sources into AWS Athena optimized parquet files on S3.

**Tesla** *Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Manager* __2013 to 2018__

* Built and Maintained robust back end infrastructure on top of Docker and Ansible. My design made it easy to provision and manage a Spark cluster and various Micro-Services between two people while also providing statistical models and TB scale log analytics.

* Established an analytics workflow leveraging git version control, with jira integrations. Designed the ETL workflow using spark, airflow, jupyter and superset.

* Provided direction on proactive maintenance campaign and prognostics algorithm development using machine learning techniques: *random forest, logistic regression, physics of failure.*

* Established an extensive code base that provides tools to the organization for extracting, transforming, and analyzing field data at scale.

* Developed a modern approach to advanced warranty simulation in Python that can account for competing failure modes in a repairable system under varying use conditions.

* Developed statistical frame work for python:	*Weibull analysis,	Stress-Strength Convolution,	Hypothesis testing,	Best fit solver, generalized distribution framework, newton-raphson solver,	ranking methods,	mttf*


**Ingersoll Rand** *Reliability Engineer* __2011 to 2013__

**Medtronic INC.** *Product Performance Specialist* __2010 to 2011__

**Boeing Corporation** *Systems Engineer* __2008 to 2009__
