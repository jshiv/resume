### Experience

**Tesla Motors** *Associate Manager, Data Science | Reliability* __2015 to Present__
Grew the Data Science team and capacity within the organization. Evangelized the need for data and infrastructure to facilitate data driven decision making.

Developed Ansible/Docker deployment architecture for a Spark standalone cluster and python libraries for efficient manipulation and processing of log data.

Established an analytics workflow leveraging git version control, with jira integrations. Designed the ETL workflow using spark, airflow, jupyter and superset.

Provided direction on proactive maintenance campaign and prognostics algorithm development using machine learning techniques: *random forest, logistic regression, physics of failure.*


**Tesla Motors** *Senior Data Scientist* __2014 to 2015__
Innovated in the approach to Reliability Engineering by incorporating the tools of Data Science.

Established an extensive code base that provides tools to the organization for extracting, transforming, and analyzing field data at scale.

Developed a modern approach to advanced warranty simulation in Python that can account for competing failure modes in a repairable system under varying use conditions.


**Tesla Motors** *Reliabilty Data Scientist* __2013 to 2014__
Developed the tools required for analyzing fleet logs at scale, and characterizing usage conditions.

Developed methods to automate Weibull analysis for all parts of the vehicle. Built a statistically defined generation identifier for failure modes.

Developed statistical frame work for python:	*Weibull analysis,	Stress-Strength Convolution,	Hypothesis testing,	Best fit solver, generalized distribution framework, newton-raphson solver,	ranking methods,	mttf*


**Ingersoll Rand** *Reliability Engineer* __2011 to 2013__
Drove product reliability and provided reliability metrics to upper management.


**Medtronic INC.** *Product Performance Specialist* __2010 to 2011__
