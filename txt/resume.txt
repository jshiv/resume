Experience

WAYMO [CONTRACT WITH ADECCO] _Senior Data Scientist_ JUNE 2018 TO
PRESENT

-   Developed Metropolis Hastings algorithm in Go for sampling from a
    Weibull posterior with arbitrary priors.

-   Developed Markov chain Monte Carlo python code base for accurately
    forecasting field failures in complex systems.

-   Developed Reliability analytics data pipeline and dashboards for
    report automation.

MAYFIELD ROBOTICS [CONTRACT] _Data Engineer, Consultant_ MARCH 2018 TO
JUNE 2018

-   Data Warehouse: Designed and implemented analytics data
    infrastructure using spark via AWS Glue to process robot logs and
    disparate data sources into AWS Athena optimized parquet files
    on S3.

TESLA _Associate Manager, Data Science | Reliability_ 2015 TO 2018

-   Built and Maintained robust back end infrastructure on top of Docker
    and Ansible. My design made it easy to provision and manage a Spark
    cluster and various Micro-Services between two people while also
    providing statistical models and TB scale log analytics.

-   Established an analytics workflow leveraging git version control,
    with jira integrations. Designed the ETL workflow using spark,
    airflow, jupyter and superset.

-   Provided direction on proactive maintenance campaign and prognostics
    algorithm development using machine learning techniques: _random
    forest, logistic regression, physics of failure._

TESLA _Senior Data Scientist_ 2014 TO 2015

-   Established an extensive code base that provides tools to the
    organization for extracting, transforming, and analyzing field data
    at scale.

-   Developed a modern approach to advanced warranty simulation in
    Python that can account for competing failure modes in a repairable
    system under varying use conditions.

TESLA _Reliability Data Scientist_ 2013 TO 2014

-   Developed statistical frame work for python: _Weibull analysis,
    Stress-Strength Convolution, Hypothesis testing, Best fit solver,
    generalized distribution framework, newton-raphson solver, ranking
    methods, mttf_
