Experience

UDEMY _Senior Software Engineer, Data Platform_ JUNE 2019 TO PRESENT

-   Developed mysql to s3 pipeline to process mysql binlogs through a
    kafka into a scala spark streaming application that provides
    distributed updates and deletes in apache hudi format on AWS s3.

-   Used ansible and terraform to build and maintain production data
    infrastructure in AWS including multiple AWS EMR clusters that ran
    up to 880 cores and 7 TB of memory.

-   Rotated in on-call schedule to ensure infrastructure was reliable
    and ~1K jobs passed on a daily basis.

WAYMO _Senior Data Scientist_ JUNE 2018 TO JUNE 2019

-   Designed and developed the python run feature extractor pipeline.
    Built on apache beam, flume, borg, python and protobuff, the
    framework provides users a simple design pattern to extract
    features[counts, histograms, rainflow matrix], from vehicle and sds
    log data, and then to scale over the whole fleet processing 100's of
    TB in minutes.

-   Developed Metropolis Hastings algorithm in Go for sampling from a
    Weibull posterior with arbitrary priors.

-   Developed Markov chain Monte Carlo python code base for accurately
    forecasting field failures in complex systems.

-   Developed Reliability analytics data pipeline and dashboards for
    report automation.

MAYFIELD ROBOTICS _Data Engineer, Consultant_ MARCH 2018 TO JUNE 2018

-   Data Warehouse: Designed and implemented analytics data
    infrastructure using spark via AWS Glue to process robot logs and
    disparate data sources into AWS Athena optimized parquet files
    on S3.

TESLA _Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Manager_ 2013 TO 2018

-   Built and Maintained robust back end infrastructure on top of Docker
    and Ansible. My design made it easy to provision and manage a Spark
    cluster and various Micro-Services between two people while also
    providing statistical models and TB scale log analytics.

-   Established an analytics workflow leveraging git version control,
    with jira integrations. Designed the ETL workflow using spark,
    airflow, jupyter and superset.

-   Provided direction on proactive maintenance campaign and prognostics
    algorithm development using machine learning techniques: _random
    forest, logistic regression, physics of failure._

-   Established an extensive code base that provides tools to the
    organization for extracting, transforming, and analyzing field data
    at scale.

-   Developed a modern approach to advanced warranty simulation in
    Python that can account for competing failure modes in a repairable
    system under varying use conditions.

-   Developed statistical frame work for python: _Weibull analysis,
    Stress-Strength Convolution, Hypothesis testing, Best fit solver,
    generalized distribution framework, newton-raphson solver, ranking
    methods, mttf_
